# Color Picker

This is a basic project, but it’s my first real JavaScript project — built to understand DOM manipulation and event handling in action.

# What It Does

A simple interactive app where clicking a color button:

Changes the heading’s text color

Highlights the selected button

Smoothly resets others

# Tech Stack
